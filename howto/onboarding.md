## Introduction

Same Great Taste is offering a set of IT services to our members and friends including a secure Discord server, a secure Teamspeak server and web apps.

To use our IT services you first need to register your main character on a secure website called **RABIS Auth** and complete the onboarding process. After that you get roles on all our IT services (e.g. Discord, Mumble) and access to our apps (e.g. to request blue standing for your characters).

This page provides you a step-by-step instructions on how to connect to our IT services for the first time.

Please note that you have to go through these steps only one time. Once completed you can login to all services directly.
