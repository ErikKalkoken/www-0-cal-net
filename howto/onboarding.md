## Introduction

Same Great Taste is offering a set of IT services to our members and friends including a secure Discord server, a secure Teamspeak server and web apps.

To use our IT services you first need to register your main character on a secure website called **Alliance Auth** and complete the onboarding process. After that you get roles on all our IT services (e.g. Discord, Teamspeak) and access to our alliance apps (e.g. to request blue standing for your characters).

This page provides you a step-by-step instructions on how to connect to our alliance services for the first time.

Please note that you have to go through these steps only one time. Once completed you can login to all services directly.

## Connect to Alliance Auth

Alliance Auth is our central website for registering your characters and connecting to other alliance services. Please make sure to complete this part before you try connecting to any of our other services.

## Connect to Teamspeak

To get access to alliance roles on Teamspeak you need to connect your main on Alliance Auth to your Teamspeak client.

**Using Teamspeak on multiple devices** \\
If you use Teamspeak on multiple devices (e.g. one Teamspeak client on your PC at home, one at work) please make sure to use the **same** Teamspeak identity on all clients. Since Alliance Auth can only connect your main to one identity you would otherwise only have alliance roles on one of your clients.\\
To transfer your Teamspeak identity from one client to another follow the instructions provided on [this page](https://tserverhq.com/clients/knowledgebase/89/How-do-I-transfer-my-TeamSpeak-3-Identity-to-another-computer.html).
