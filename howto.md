## Introduction

To use our alliance services you first need to authenticate your main character on our secure website called **Alliance Auth**. This website is our central hub that helps us keep track of your accounts across our services (e.g. Discord, Teamspeak) and also the place where you find our alliance apps (e.g. Standings Requests).

**Important**

> By using our Alliance Services you are giving your explicit consent that our services can have full read access to all of your characters while you are a member of the alliance. This is required to provide productivity services and to ensure a high level of security for our alliance.

## Connect to Alliance Auth

Open you web browser and go to: [https://auth.0-cal.net/](https://auth.0-cal.net/)
